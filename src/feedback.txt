***SPECIFIC (RecursiveSorter)
For readability, your wrapper and your recursive function should have the same name
Clear up the conditional statements in your recursive function so that they follow a base case / recursive case pattern
Link your conditional statements! You either have a base or recursive case, never both.
Reads are not counted correctly.
Writes are not counted correctly in MergeSort	 as you are using arrays outside of the IntegerArray class. Minor point, but worth fixing.
Challenge: can you make your MergeSort have complexity of 2n (instead of n-logn, as it is currently)? That is, instead of declaring new arrays at each step, re-use a single 'spare' array?
